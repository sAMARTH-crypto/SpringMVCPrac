# Spring MVC Project

This repository contains a basic Spring MVC project that includes a login form, model classes, controller classes, and corresponding view files (.jsp files). The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and is designed to handle user requests and render views.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- **src/main/java**: Contains the Java source code for the project.
  - **com.demo.project.model**: Contains the model classes for the login form.
  - **com.demo.project.controller**: Contains the controller classes that handle the requests and perform the necessary logic.
  - *(You can add new controller classes and methods here as per your requirements)*

- **src/main/resources**: Contains the resource files for the project.
  - **application-context.xml**: XML-based configuration file where you can define beans and configure Spring framework settings.
  - *(You can update this file as needed for your project)*

- **src/main/webapp**: Contains the web application files.
  - **WEB-INF/views**: Contains the view files (.jsp files) for rendering the HTML templates.
  - *(Create new .jsp files here for any additional views you introduce)*

- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file that manages the project's dependencies.

## Getting Started

## Modifying the Project

When making changes to the project, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- If you add new controller classes or methods, make sure to create corresponding view files (.jsp files) in the `WEB-INF/views` directory. Failure to do so may result in errors when trying to render the views.

- Update the `application-context.xml` file if you need to define new beans or modify the Spring framework configuration.

- Update the `pom.xml` file to manage the project's dependencies. You can add new dependencies or update existing ones as per your project's needs.
